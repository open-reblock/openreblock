        <p class="intro-text">The examples below (click to view) show reblocking solutions in slums. These solutions provide universal access to every place of residence and work in slums by building streets and paths in a minimally disruptive way. A minimal access width to each place is necessary for generating the conditions for neighborhood development and resilience. This includes providing each place with an address, urban services such as toilets and improved drainage, and emergency services, such as fire protection and health assistance.</p>
        <p class="intro-text">We show how an algorithm based on neighborhood topology suggests optimal reblocking solutions that provide access to all places within an arbitrary slum using a minimal amount of construction and costs.</p>
