        <p class="intro-text">In the developed world, we take it for granted that every home or place of work has access to basic services. This includes clean water, electricity, sanitation, and access for emergency vehicles in case of need, such as ambulances or fire trucks. But this is far from being the rule in most developing cities and is a particularly stark challenge in informal settlements (slums), home for over 1 billion people around the world.</p><!--
        <p class="intro-text">Residents of these neighborhoods are working to develop solutions for their own neighborhoods, and city planners around the world are becoming convinced that these settlements are not going anywhere. In both cases, people recognize that it is time to adapt to this new reality and start delivering formal infrastructure to the urban places where people lack access to it. However, since these settlements were laid out so that many structures lack road access, the only way to deliver water or remove refuse for a home is directly through other homes. The question for informal settlement residents and urban planners alike is: how to deliver infrastructure to all the homes in a block with minimal disruption? Can maps and computers help?</p> -->
        <p class="intro-text">Reblocking is the process of physically transforming an informal settlement to provide an access path to all its structures. This project analyzes the spatial structure of informal city blocks, and uses an algorithm to suggest reblocking solutions that provide access to all structures within the block in a minimally disruptive way. Click on one of the examples below to see the process unfold.</p>
