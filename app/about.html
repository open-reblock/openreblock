      <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
        <p>Reblocking is a process of allowing an informal settlement to get access to services, roads, and other benefits of a road network. You can see an example of the reblocking process in <a href="http://sdinet.org/2015/02/launch-of-upgrading-at-flamingo-crescent-with-cape-town-mayor-patricia-de-lille/">this blog post</a> from Slum/Shack Dwellers International. This project aims to create a web-based service for an open-source code base that develops the least-invasive network of roads or paths to bring infrastructure to informal settlements.</p>

        <h3>Reblocking Process and Data</h3>
        <p>This work began through a collaboration with <a href="http://sdinet.org/">Slum/Shack Dwellers International</a>. SDI has used the reblocking process throughout their network. Data and detailed examples were provided with help from SDI federations in <a href="http://sasdialliance.org.za/about/corc/">South Africa</a> (Community Organisation Resource Centre) and <a href="http://dialogueonshelter.co.zw/">Zimbabwe</a> (Zimbabwe Homeless People’s Federation and Dialogue on Shelter).</p>
