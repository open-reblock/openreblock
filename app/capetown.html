This map shows a block in Khayelitsha, a township in Capetown, South Africa. These parcels were identified from March 2009 aerial photography, in conjunction with a data collection exercise by Community Organisation Resource Centre (CORC) and the Santa Fe Institute. In this map, black lines show new roads and paths, orange outlines parcels with no direct access to roads or paths. Parcels with street access are outlined in grey.
