This access, far from being a natural feature of cities, is a challenge in informal settlements, home for over 1 billion people around the world. These people live in city blocks that are often built literally “off the grid,” and many of their homes have no street access.</p> <p class=intro-text>City planners around the world are becoming convinced that these settlements are not going anywhere, and that it is time to adapt to this new reality and start delivering proper infrastructure to places where many people lack access to it. However, since these settlements were laid out informally, the only way to deliver water or remove refuse for a home is directly through other homes. The question for urban planners and informal settlement residents alike is: how to deliver infrastructure to all the homes in a block with minimal disruption? And can maps and computers help?</p> <p class=intro-text>Reblocking is a process of physical transformation of an informal settlement, to provide street access to all its structures. This project analyzes the spatial structure of informal city blocks, and algorithmically suggests reblocking solutions that provide access to all structures within that block with a minimum of disruption. Click on one of the examples below to see the process unfold.</p> </div> </div> <div class=row> <div class=col-sm-6> <div class="project-container link"> <a class=project-link href=/epworth.html> <div class=project-header> <h3 class=project-title>Harare, Zimbabwe</h3> <p class=project-description>This is a small city block with 7 interior parcels (orange). These parcels lack street access. By adding six new street segments (just over 100m) all places become connected to the existing street network.</p> </div> <div class=project-img> <img class="img-responsive img-rounded" src=/images/epworth.png> </div> </a> </div> </div> <div class=col-sm-6> <div class="project-container link"> <a class=project-link href=/capetown.html> <div class=project-header> <h3 class=project-title>Cape Town, South Africa</h3> <p class=project-description>This is a much larger and denser city block with 390 interior parcels (orange). To access the most internal places, one must cross at least five other parcels. Optimal reblocking suggests the addition of over 1000m of new streets.</p> </div> <div class=project-img> <img class="img-responsive img-rounded" src=/images/capetown.png> </div> </a> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class=footer> <p>&copy; 2015 Santa Fe Institute &amp; the Regents of the University of California</p> </div> </div>  <script>
